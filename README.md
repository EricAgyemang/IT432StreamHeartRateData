# IT432StreamHeartRateData
This is an example of how to build a data pipeline that starts with an Internet of Things (IoT) device that captures the heart rate, leverage IoT core to securely publish the data to a message queue where it will then be transported into a data warehouse. Here, a Raspberry Pi with a heart rate sensor is used for the IoT device and components of Google cloud platform will form the data pipeline
