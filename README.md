# INTRODUCTION
# IT432 Stream Heart Rate Data
This is an example of how to build a data pipeline that starts with an Internet of Things (IoT) device that captures the heart rate, leverage IoT core to securely publish the data to a message queue where it will then be transported into a data warehouse. Here, a Raspberry Pi with a heart rate sensor is used for the IoT device and components of Google cloud platform will form the data pipeline.

This example is not an officially supported Google product, does not have a SLA/SLO, and should not be used in production
